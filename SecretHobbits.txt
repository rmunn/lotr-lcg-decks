Deck Created with CardGameDB.com The Lord of the Rings Deckbuilder


NOTES:
A little light on allies at the moment. If I keep 3 copies of every card, that's something like 80 cards. With just 2 copies, it's manageable.

Glorfindel will be replaced by Spirit Merry, who starts at 6 threat. Starting threat is 20, but Merry has consistent threat reduction, which means I might be able to skip some of the other thread-reduction effects and get the deck down to 50 cards. Keep the hobbit pipes, though: too much fun.
