Deck Created with CardGameDB.com The Lord of the Rings Deckbuilder


NOTES:
Silvan deck with all four colors, thanks to Galadriel and Nenya. This is the deck as it existed in April 2015. Never tested yet, so I might still tweak it.

Note that Éomer might make a great replacement for Legolas. He couldn't receive a Bow of the Galadhrim, but he'd get +2 ATK every round anyway from characters constantly leaving play. But as constituted, the deck had Legolas rather than Éomer.

Sideboard:
Rivendell Bow (x1? x2?)
Rivendell Blade x2 (character, not hero)
Light of Valinor x2 (perhaps allowing Naith Guide to go on other heroes)
Lembas x2
Elven Mail x2
Cloak of Lórien x3
