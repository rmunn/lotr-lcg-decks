## Robin's LotR LCG decks

These files represent some of the decks that I've build for the Lord of the
Rings card game, published by Fantasy Flight Games. The text files are in the
export format produced by the CardGameDB.com deckbuilder, while the .o8d files
are in OCTGN format.

Note that many of these decks are/were works-in-progress. Many of them aren't
even really decks, just lists of cards that I might want to put into a deck.
Don't expect any, or even most, of these to be playable. Eventually I'll go
through and clean up these files to leave only *actual* decklists that are
playable. For now, though, this is a record of all the decks and card lists
that I put together, good or bad, so that they can be saved for future use.
