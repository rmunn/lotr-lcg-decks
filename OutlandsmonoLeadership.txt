Deck Created with CardGameDB.com The Lord of the Rings Deckbuilder


NOTES:
Everyone needs an Outlands deck. Who needs strategy when you've got Slivers... I mean Outlands allies?

This is a mono-Leadership build. If playing with another deck that also includes Steward of Gondor, the 4-cost cards might be replaced with a second or third copy of some of the 1-cost events like Campfire Tales, Valient Sacrifice, and Second Breakfast.
