Deck Created with CardGameDB.com The Lord of the Rings Deckbuilder


NOTES:
Everyone needs an Outlands deck. Who needs strategy when you've got Slivers... I mean Outlands allies?

This was my original build, made when the pack just came out. Thus, it does not include cards like Forlong, Lord of Morthond, or Men of the West.
