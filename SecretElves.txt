Deck Created with CardGameDB.com The Lord of the Rings Deckbuilder


NOTES:
What do Galadriel and Celeborn get up to on date night? It's a secret.

Suffers a bit from the need for Nenya or the deck doesn't work, but the Mirror usually helps. Second Breakfast allows retrieving vital attachments (Nenya, O Lorien) if the Mirror discards them.

FURTHER NOTES:
Brought deck from 71 cards to 50 by taking 2 copies of everything instead of 3. After playtesting, will sort out what's needed and what isn't.

This could be a very good support deck: the Handmaiden can lower someone else's threat, and so can Galadriel if her own threat is below 20 already.
