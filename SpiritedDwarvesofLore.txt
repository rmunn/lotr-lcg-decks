Deck Created with CardGameDB.com The Lord of the Rings Deckbuilder


NOTES:
An old deck; I'm not quite sure where I was going with it. I think I was going for Secrecy...? Old strategy notes follow:

A companion deck to be used alongside Leadership/Tactics dwarf decks.

Strategy TBD once I play with this deck a bit.
