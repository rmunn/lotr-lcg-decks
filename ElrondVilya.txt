Elrond+Vilya

---
Mulligan for Vilya if not in opening hand.
Other ways to get Vilya: Gandalf+Word of Command, Master of the Forge, Imladris Stargazer. A Very Good Tale could also be pressed into service if the Stargazer is turning up nothing, as it shuffles the deck.

"Sideboard" for this deck (cards I'm also considering putting in as I tweak the deck):

Resourceful x1-3 (as a Vilya target)
Beorning Beekeeper x1-3 (ditto)
Veteran of Nanduhirion x1-3 (ditto)
Landroval x1 (ditto)
DÃºnedain Wanderer x1-2 (ditto)

Readying mechanics like Common Cause, Grim Resolve, etc., may not be so useful because they cannot ready Vilya, only Elrond.

"Sideboarded" heroes (which might change the deck composition greatly if, say, Spirit gets dropped in favor of Tactics):
Elrohir (Leadership) / Elladan (Tactics) - as a set
Gimli (Tactics)
Beregond (Tactics)
