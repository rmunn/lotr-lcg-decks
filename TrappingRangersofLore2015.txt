Deck Created with CardGameDB.com The Lord of the Rings Deckbuilder


NOTES:
Mono-Lore Ranger/Traps deck. Still needs testing.

Expert Treasure-Hunter names Attachment, usually.

Consider replacing Ithilien Trackers with Ithilien Lookouts. Actually, just re-vamp the deck entirely as it's really not very good.

Deck as it existed in April 2015.
